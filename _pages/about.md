I recently graduated with a Ph.D from the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu). I am presently working as Applied Scientist at [Microsoft, New England](https://microsoftnewengland.com) (Cambridge, MA). I am a part of Microsoft's highly selective AI Development Acceleration Program (MAIDAP).  

My research focuses on causal machine learning, probabilistic models and uncertainty estimation. During my PhD, I developed novel generative architectures to incorporate rich, unstructured information in modern datasets within the framework of causal inference. I also worked on improving the reliability of predictive uncertainties in probabilistic models in the context of causal inference, deep learning and sequential decision-making. 

I graduated with BTech in Computer Science from [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), where I worked on online query optimization in databases with [Prof S. Sudarshan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sudarsha/) and on empirical evaluation of derivative clouds with [Prof Umesh Bellur](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~umesh/index.html). I also worked with [Prof Bernard Moret](https://people.epfl.ch/bernard.moret) as a [Summer@EPFL](https://summer.epfl.ch) scholar.
