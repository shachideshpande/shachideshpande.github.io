I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu). I am presently working at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu) in New York. I am advised by [Prof. Volodymyr Kuleshov](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kuleshov/). 

My research focuses on causal machine learning, probabilistic models and uncertainty estimation. During my PhD, I developed novel generative architectures to incorporate rich, unstructured information in modern datasets within the framework of causal inference. I also work on improving the reliability of predictive uncertainties in probabilistic models in the context of causal inference, deep learning and sequential decision-making. I am interested in applications of my research to the identification of causal genetic variants in genome-wide association studies and performing accurate uncertainty quantification of polygenic risk scores in humans. 

I graduated with BTech in Computer Science from [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), where I worked on online query optimization in databases with [Prof S. Sudarshan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~sudarsha/) and on empirical evaluation of derivative clouds with [Prof Umesh Bellur](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~umesh/index.html). I also worked with [Prof Bernard Moret](https://people.epfl.ch/bernard.moret) as a [Summer@EPFL](https://summer.epfl.ch) scholar.
